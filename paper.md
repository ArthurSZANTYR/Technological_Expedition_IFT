Plant diseases pose a significant problem for agriculture, especially considering the increasing pressure caused by climate change on plants, exposing them to new stressors. These stresses can be triggered by factors like drought, flooding, extreme temperatures, and alterations in soil composition. Within agriculture, these stresses can lead to production losses, decreased product quality, and even plant mortality. Early detection of diseases is crucial to enable farmers to address them before they cause substantial damage.

The use of deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), emerges as an effective solution for detecting these plant diseases. By employing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), these networks can identify intricate patterns within images, making them ideal for pinpointing disease symptoms on plant leaves with high precision.

This paper introduces a method for early detection of plant diseases based on deep learning. The aim of this method is to be accessible and user-friendly for farmers. To achieve this goal, the method will be implemented as a web application accessible via a smartphone or tablet equipped with a camera, making this technology available to a larger number of farmers without requiring additional hardware.

In this study, we will conduct experiments on basil plants subjected to various stresses. We will simulate a range of conditions such as drought, flooding, and alterations in soil composition. Photos of the plant leaves at different stress stages will be taken. Subsequently, our deep learning model will be used to predict the type of stress experienced by the plants.

We hope this experiment will demonstrate that our model can accurately predict the stress experienced by the plants before it becomes visible to the naked eye. This capability could enable farmers to take preventive measures to safeguard their crops.
